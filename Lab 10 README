# CS151 Lab 10
* (skip 9)
* 50  points  
* Due by start of next lab 

## Problem 
Create a program that will analyze data on the passenger of the Titanic. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to give you practice with

1. reading from a file
2. processing Strings
3. function design and implementation
4. error checking

## The Data
The input data was taken from http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/DataSets but has been altered so that each of the 7 data values (fields) for each passenger is separated from the next by a tab ("\t" is how you represent a tab in code). 
Each line contains: Class, Survived, Name, Sex, Age, Embark, Destination
* Class is either 1 or 2 or 3, and denotes the type of ticket purchased  
* Survived is either 1 or 0  (1 means survived and 0 means died)  
* Name is a string  
* Age is a real number  (babies have ages < 1; unavailable ages are shown as 0)  
* Sex is either “female” or “male”  
* Embark is either ‘C’ or ‘S’ or ’Q’  (for Cherbourg, Southampton, or Queenstown)  
* Destination is a string. Unavailable data is shown as XXX.  


## Your Goal with the Data
Your program should determine the following for the user:

1. The total number of people to survive
2. The percentage of each class who survived in the format "XX.X%" (e.g. 6.9%, 76.4%)
3. A bar graph showing the percentage of each class who survived. You can create a bar graph by following the steps listed in the next section.

## Being able to Graph

### Installation
First, you need to install the matplotlib package by following these instructions in PyCharm after opening your Lab 10 repository.

1. Go to File Preferences/Settings
2. Click on your Project
3. Click on Python Interpreter
4. Click on the plus symbol above the list of packages
5. Search for "matplotlib"
6. Click on matplotlib, then click "Install"

### Code
This code has made up data. You will instead create your lists for plotting based on the data from your file.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# made up data for the purpose of demonstration
mydata =[60, 50, 23, 69, 42] #value for each bar (e.g. how tall it is)
xaxis=["A","B","C","D","E"] #label for each bar

# creating a bar graph
plt.bar(xaxis, mydata)
plt.show()
``` 

If you would (in the future) like to save your graph, you can replace `plt.show()` with `plt.savefig("yourfilenamehere.png")` **NOTE: you *MUST* end with .png**. 

## Your Steps for Coding

NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR AN ALGORITHM. FOLLOW THE STEPS.

1. Understand the problem
2. Write code to read in the file and correctly store it in a list of lists. Output your list to make sure it is in the correct format before continuing.
3. *Switch Driver*. Write a function to determine the total number of people to survive. The function should return this information. Output in main.
4. *Switch Driver*. Write a function to determine the percentage of feach class who survived, and return that data to main.
5. *Switch Driver*. Write the output in main to output the percentage from each class who survived.
6. Check your output against the answers we already created in Excel in class, to make sure your code works correctly.
7. *Switch Driver*. Add in the code to plot the percentages as a bar graph.
8. Add in any comments you haven't added already (function header comments, comments within functions, intro comments).
9. If you have time remaining, you can attempt the extra credit.

## Extra Credit
Answer up to two of the following questions as well (+1 points for each question working correctly in the code):

1. How many children were on board, and what percentage of total passengers were they?
2. What was the average age of passengers by class?
3. What percentage of passengers were from eack Embarkation point?
4. How old was the oldest passenger and the youngest passenger?
5. Write to a file a list of all of the survivor's names and their destinations (one survivor per line)

## To Submit

To Github:
1. Your working .py file

To Moodle:
1. Your reflection about what you learned in this lab, what it was like working with your partner, and how you felt about graphing data.
