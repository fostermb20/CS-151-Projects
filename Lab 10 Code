# Lab 10
# Problem Statement: We need to analyze Titanic data and output the number of survivors and the survival rate from each class
# Data In: N/A
# Data Out: Number of survivors, survival rate from each class
# Credits: This code is our own
# Input Files: titanic.txt


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #import module in order to create bargraph

# Purpose: Read in the titanic file and store the information in a list of lists
# Parameters: Filename - variable that stores titanic.txt as the filename
# Return: titanic_list - variable that stores the titanic.txt information in a list of lists
def read_file(filename):
    titanic_list = [] #create an empty list
    file = open(filename, 'r') #read in the file
    for line in file:
        elements = line.strip().split("\t")
        titanic_list.append(elements) #iterate through the file and add the information to the empty list
    return titanic_list #return the list

# Purpose: Count the number of survivors
# Parameters: titanic_list - variable that stores the titanic.txt information in a list of lists
# Return: survivors - variable that stores the total number of survivors
def count_survivors(titanic_list):
    survivors = 0 #initalize the survivor count
    for passengers in titanic_list:

            survivors += 1 #iterate through the file and count the number of survivors
    print("Number of survivors:", survivors) #output the number of survivors
    return survivors #return the number of survivors

# Purpose: Calculate the survival rate of each class
# Parameters: titanic_list - variable that stores the titanic.txt information in a list of lists
# Return: class_1_survived_percentage, class_2_survived_percentage, class_3_survived_percentage - variables that store the survival rate of each class
