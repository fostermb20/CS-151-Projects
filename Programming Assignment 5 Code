# Programming Assignment 5
# Problem Statement: Read a file and output a list of words to a new file depending on what the user chooses to do.
# Data In: Input file name, option (1-5), output file name, option (1-5) again
# Data Out: List of words respective to what option the user chose.
# Credits: Used ZyBook Ch. 12 to help
# Input Files: 5letterwords.txt

import os #import statement to be used to check if file exists

# Purpose: read in the file
# Parameters: filename — variable that allows user to enter the file
# Return: words_list — variable that stores the words in the file, [] — empty list if error received

# Purpose: find words with a certain letter in it
# Parameters: letter — variable that stores user's choice of letter to look for, file_out — variable that stores user's choice of name for the output file
