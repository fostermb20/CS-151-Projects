# Programmer: Michael Foster
# Course:  CS151, Dr. Kenyon
# Due Date: 2/1/22
# Programming Assignment: 1
# Problem Statement: My mom needs to know how many 1-gallon cans of paint to buy in order to paint the walls of her bedroom.
# Data In: Length of room, width of room, height of ceilings, length of any windows, width of any windows, length of doorway, width of doorway,
# Data Out: Total amount of 1-gallon cans of paint required to paint the bedroom, thanking my mom for using the program
# Credits: No, this code is my own.
